# 🎯 QA Portfolio – Manual & Automated

Welcome to my Quality Assurance Portfolio!  
Here you will find my Manual QA, Automated Testing projects, and SQL validation examples.

## 👤 About Me

After more than 10 years of study and work in the field of Communication — with an undergraduate degree from UFPB, a master's degree from the University of Málaga, and even an attempt at a PhD (not completed, but full of learnings) — I decided to take a bold step and transition into the Software Quality (Quality Assurance) area.

I never imagined I would follow this path, but life has curious ways of presenting new opportunities. This change has been both challenging and extremely enriching.

During this journey, I have been deepening my knowledge in QA fundamentals, quality control, and software testing practices, exploring everything from **Verification and Validation, SDLC, and STLC** to creating **Test Plans, Test Cases, Test Scenarios, and Test Evidence**.

### 🔍 Types of Testing I work with:

- Functional and Non-Functional Testing  
- Manual and Automated Testing  
- Regression, Integration, System, and Acceptance (UAT) Testing  
- Performance, Security, API, and UI Testing  
- Approaches like Black-Box and White-Box Testing  

### 🛠 Tools and Technologies:

- Jira, Trello, Qase.io  
- Postman, Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, JMeter, RestAssured, Appium  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, REST APIs, JSON, XML, Git/GitHub/GitLab  

### 📊 Processes and Methodologies:

- Agile, Scrum, Kanban, DevOps, CI/CD, Shift-left Testing  
- Bug Tracking and Incident Reporting
